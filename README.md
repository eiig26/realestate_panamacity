# From Web Scraping to Machine Learning: Understanding Panama City's Real Estate with Python

Introduction
We explore the dynamic real estate landscape in Panama City! In this data science journey, we explore on a fascinating research of apartment information sourced directly from the ACOBIR website. ACOBIR, the Panamanian Chamber of Real Estate Brokers and Developers, provides a lot of data that allows us to gain insights into the property market of Panama City.

Our goal isn't just to gather data but to know all about behind each apartment listing. From web scraping ACOBIR's pages to unleashing the power of machine learning, this project is a comprehensive endeavor to decode the factors influencing property prices in this amazing city.

We start with data cleaning, data visualization, and predictive modeling. By the end of this journey, we aim not only to understand the current state of the real estate market but to predict property prices and recommend projects that align with the city's unique dynamics.
